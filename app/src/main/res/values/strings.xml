    <string name="about_text">Vector Pinball 1.9.1\nÂ© 2010-2020 Brian Nenninger\nComments and bug reports: bnenning@gmail.com\n\nTouch the screen to start a new game, launch a ball if one is not in play, and activate the flippers. Touch the score area to pause the game.\n\n[TABLE_RULES]\n\nSelecting the Preferences button or menu item allows you to change the following settings:\n- Sound: Enables and disables sound effects\n- Background Music: Enables and disabled background music\n- Independent Flippers: When unchecked, any touch activates both flippers. When checked, you must touch the left side of the screen for the left flipper, and the right side for the right flipper.\n- Zoom: When checked, the view will be zoomed on the ball\'s location during game play.\n- OpenGL Rendering: Uses OpenGL to draw graphics. This usually provides the best combination of graphics quality and performance, but some devices may do better with it disabled.\n- Show FPS: When checked, shows frames drawn per second in the upper left.\n\nVector Pinball is open source; the code is at https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball\n\nThanks to Mario at www.badlogicgames.com for code improvements and libgdx.\n\nsound, music, &amp; audio code, by pdx\nTwittering Machine\nhttps://www.twittering.com</string>

    <string name="table5_rules">Table Rules:\n- The central circle has twelve points around it, 3 each of 4 colors. Shooting a top ramp will change the color of the ball and allow it to activate the points with matching color.\n- When all 12 points around the circle are activated, hitting the edges of the rotating triangle will remove them. Shoot the target in the middle of the triangle to start multiball.\n- During multiball, light the 12 circle points again to score a jackpot, which increases in value each time.\n- The game starts with ball savers in the left and right outlanes, which disappear when used. Hit all drop targets on the left or right side to restore them.</string>
    <string name="table6_rules">Table Rules:\n- In the center of the table, five planets orbit a sun. When the ball rolls over one of the planets, it changes to the planet\'s color and the planet starts flashing.\n- Shoot the corresponding target to &quot;activate&quot; the planet and make it solid. For the inner orange planet, hit the targets in the upper left. For the second blue planet, activate the rollovers in the upper right. For the remaining planets, shoot the ramp of the matching color.\n- Activate all five planets to start multiball. In multiball, activate all the planets again for a jackpot.\n- The game starts with ball savers in the left and right outlanes, which disappear when used. Hit all drop targets on the left or right side to restore them.\n- The sun and planets have gravity and will attract balls when they get close.</string>
    <string name="table7_rules">Table Rules:\n- The center of the table contains a star map. Shoot one of the ramps with the flashing green arrows to cause the map to move to a constellation.\n- The stars that make up the constellation will appear in green. Roll the ball over them to activate them; they will turn yellow and lines will connect activated stars to draw the constellation outline.\n- When the constellation outline is complete, shoot the right ramp with the flashing yellow arrow to lock the ball. Repeat this process with two more constellations. Locking the third ball will start multiball.\n- In multiball, complete the remaining constellations and then shoot the right ramp for a jackpot.\n- The game starts with ball savers in the left and right outlanes, which disappear when used. Hit all drop targets on the left or right side to restore them.</string>
